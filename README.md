# Computer vision practice with deep learning, Spring 2023

This course is a graduate-level computer vision course, focusing on 2D computer vision. This course will provide a pragmatic introduction to computer vision, with an aim to walk through milestone models and research papers in the literature. This course will explore practical solutions from the latest literature for solving computer vision tasks with various data, label, and deployment constrains.

This repo contains my solutions to the homework as well as the final project.
